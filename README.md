# **Project Report: Breast Cancer Classification**
## **Overview**
The Breast Cancer Classification project aims to build a machine learning model to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on the provided dataset. This project is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The solution is presented as a Jupyter Notebook for better code readability and visualization.
## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass tissue. Each instance includes:

- Numerical measurements of tumor features such as radius, texture, and smoothness.
- A target label indicating whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).
### **Features:**
1. Mean radius
1. Mean texture
1. Mean smoothness 
### **Target Variable:**
- **Diagnosis**: 1 for malignant and 0 for benign.
## **Workflow**
### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- **Handling Missing Values**: Checked for missing or null values and filled/dropped them accordingly.
- **Feature Selection**: Selected the most relevant features to improve the model's performance.
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Scaled the numerical data for consistent input to machine learning models.
### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized the distribution of features and target variables.
- Identified potential correlations between features using heatmaps and scatter plots.
### **3. Model Training**
- Implemented the following machine learning algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Used cross-validation to assess model performance.
### **4. Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated models based on metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
### **5. Final Model**
- Selected the best-performing model and fine-tuned its hyperparameters.
## **Results**
- Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** with the selected model.
- Precision, recall, and F1-score were also reported for both classes.
- The model was validated on unseen data to ensure generalizability.
## **Visualizations**
- Included plots such as:
  - Feature importance (for tree-based models)
  - ROC-AUC curves
  - Confusion matrix
